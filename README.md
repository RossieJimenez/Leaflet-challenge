# Earthquake Visualization
This project visualizes earthquake data obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). It provides an interactive map displaying earthquake locations, magnitudes, depths, and additional information.

## Getting Started
To run the visualization, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The map will display earthquake data obtained from the USGS GeoJSON feed.

## Features
* Interactive Map: The interactive map interface allows users to visualize earthquake locations and explore seismic activity across different regions.
* Marker Size and Color: Each earthquake is represented by a marker on the map, with marker size indicating magnitude and color indicating depth. This visual encoding enables users to quickly identify the intensity and depth of each seismic event.
* Pop-up Information: Clicking on individual markers displays detailed information about the corresponding earthquake, including magnitude, location, depth, and timestamp. This additional information enhances users' understanding of each seismic event and its potential impact.
* Depth Legend: A legend is provided to explain the color scale used to represent earthquake depth. This legend serves as a reference guide for interpreting the depth ranges associated with different colors on the map.
Responsive Design: The visualization tool is designed to be responsive, allowing users to explore earthquake data on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Usage
Click on a marker to view details about a specific earthquake.
Use the legend to understand the depth ranges represented by marker colors.
Explore the map by zooming in/out and panning.

## Built With
Leaflet.js - JavaScript library for interactive maps.
D3.js - JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.

## Data Source
The earthquake data is obtained from the USGS GeoJSON feed: USGS Earthquake Data
